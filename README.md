# KabaSuji How to Play

## Builder
The KabaSuji Builder allows a user to create a levels and level packages to play in the main KabaSuji game.

In order to run the KabaSuji builder run the file `MainBuilder.java` as a java application. This will open the KabaSuji Builder window and get you to the home screen. From the builder home screen you have the option to (1) create a new package which will have you create a new level and save as a package, or (2) add a new level you’ll create to an already existing package. If you wish to add a level to an existing KabaSuji levels package, you will need to select the ‘Add Level to Package’ button. 

No matter which option you select from the home screen you will be prompted to create a level. In the next screen, shown bellow, you can add a level name, change the size of the board and chose which level type your level will be. You can also grey out tiles on the board that you do not wish to make available for pieces to be placed on by clicking that tile on the board.

In the next screen you can create pieces, hints, place numbers on the board if you’re playing a release level, add random pieces to the bullpen, and set the number of moves or time limit for your given level. For the release level view, tap the number  button to increment the number and **right click to change the color.** Tap the ‘Place#’ button to start putting the numbers on the board.
